(*
    A function maps a single input to a single output.  Functions in functional
    languages (and an increasing number of non-functional languages!) are
    *first-class*.  This means that they can be used in every context that
    a variable can be used in.  You'll see them passed around as arguments
    and returned from functions, for example.

    When it comes right down to it, that's the essence of computation:
    taking inputs and mapping them to outputs in line with some logic.
    Unsurprisingly, functions are used everywhere in functional programming!
    In fact, in some other functional languages, things like if-statements are
    just functions rather than keywords.

(*
    In a functional language, functions are used for almost everything.

    In "mainstream" object-orientation (e.g. C# or Java), you would make
    objects and methods and inheritance and all of that jazz to structure your
    program's logic.  Every method must be in an object, and we create
    objects and call methods to make things happen.

    In functional programming, we do all of this with functions.  It is normal
    to make very small functions, and then combine them in various ways to
    achieve a goal.  There are operators in the language to make this easier,
    and these operators (of course!) are merely functions themselves, just like
    (+), (*), (-), and so on.

        functions to make a new function.  Composing functions is a very powerful

        something new.  Functional programmers often make small functions that they

    When we develop real systems, we often run into problems
    around time and timing.  For example, consider how a web
    browser might work.  It loads images and videos and text
    and all sorts of things on a webpage.  But only a small
    portion of that webpage is visible to a user at a time, and it
    is wasteful (and affects performance!) to pull down an image
    that might never be seen, or to do the work of decoding a
    video which can't be seen by the user.  So, what do we do?

    If you think carefully about it, you will realize that this is a
    timing problem.  We don't know what the user will do, and
    we don't know when (if ever!) a particular thing will be
    required.  What we want is a way to *DEFER* work, so that
    it is only done when it needs to be done.

    We can use a ( unit->'a ) function to do this.  The function
    contains the code that *would* be executed to achieve the goal,
    but DOES NOT EXECUTE the code until it is called.  Remember
    that DEFINING a function is not the same as CALLING a function!
    Then, if/when we need to, we can call the function to perform
    the work only when it is necessary to do so.
